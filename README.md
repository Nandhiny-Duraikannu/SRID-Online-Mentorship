## Limitation
- The app didn't use real backend. So the data inside the app is hardcoded. For example, the button "add grade" would only allow you add 35. 
- We didn't integrate our meeting system with 3nd party software like google hangout.
- we didn't have pagination for any list
- We don't validate the data format. For example, the meeting date could be the day before today.
